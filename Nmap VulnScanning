Vulnerability Scanning (NMAP)

Launch Kali -> Termainal -> cmd line below

Ping
Nmap -sP ipAddress

Capture IP address

sudo nmap -sS -Pn "Target IP"

  
  SYN/Stealth commands require access to raw sockets, so users may need to escalate their privileges using the sudo command.
  Some network environments will block the ‘alive check’ probes that nmap conducts prior to initiating the SYN/Stealth Scan. The -Pn switch omits the ‘alive check’, enabling the nmap scan to continue.
  In this lab environment, the -Pn is not necessary but is used to enable the discussion of when its use would be appropriate
